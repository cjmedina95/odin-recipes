# Odin Recipes

## Objective

Design a basic recipe website. 
Create an index page with three recipe pages of different foods.
The recipe pages should include an image of the food,
an unordered list of ingredients, 
and an ordered list of steps to make the food.

## Task list

- [x] Within the odin-recipes directory, create an index.html file.
- [x] Add HTML with h1 heading “Odin Recipes” to the body.
- [x] Create a new directory within the odin-recipes directory and name it recipes.
- [x] Create a new HTML file within the recipes directory and name it after the recipe it will contain.
- [x] Include an h1 heading with the recipe’s name as its content.
- [x] Add a link to the recipe page you just created.
- [x] Add an image of the finished dish under the h1 heading that you added earlier.
- [x] Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized “Description” heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.
- [x] Under the description, add an “Ingredients” heading followed by an unordered list of the ingredients needed for the recipe.
- [x] Under the ingredients list, add a “Steps” heading followed by an ordered list of the steps needed for making the dish.
- [x] Add two more recipes with identical page structures to the recipe page you’ve already created.
- [x] Link to the two new recipes on the index page.

## Review

Created an index.html file within the odin-recipes directory and wrote HTML with an h1 heading "Odin Recipes" in the body. A second directory, "recipes," was created within the odin-recipes directory, and HTML files were made for each recipe, which included h1 headings with recipe names, images of finished dishes, descriptions with <\p>, ingredients lists using <\ul>, and steps using <\ol>.
